The Department
The Department of Computer Science is offering BS Computer Science, MS Computer Science, MS Data Science, and PhD Computer Science programs.

Computer science is a field that combines scientific principles and practical applications to solve computational problems. Computer scientists specialize in designing and developing computational systems, as well as studying the theory of computation. Pursuing a degree in computer science offers a wide range of career opportunities with competitive salaries worldwide.

The impact of computer science has been felt across all aspects of human life, from personal to business. With the evolution of computing, new mechanisms and services have been created,providingnumerousjobopportunities for computer scientists. Top careers in this field include Software Development, Data Science, Data Engineering, Cloud Computing Experts, Database Administration, Business

Intelligence, Android/IOS Application Development, Game Programming, Artificial Intelligence Engineers, and Cyber Security.

To ensure that students are prepared for the demands of the international job market, computer science department in UET Taxila has focused on the latest job trends in the field. The primary objective is to equip students with high-demand skills required to persue the career in the field of Computer Science.

The department also collaborates with leading companies in the computer science industry, such as Cloudera, Oracle, VMWare, Huawei, Amazon Web Services, SAP, and Microsoft. These partnerships provide students with an industry-developed curriculum and exposure to software being used in the industry, enhancing their job readiness upon graduation. The department's academic partnerships reflect its commitment to staying current with industry standards and equipping its students with the skills needed to excel in their future careers.

Program Mission
Imparting up-to-date knowledge and skills of Computer Science to achieve the socio- economic goals for the betterment of society.

Program Educational Objectives (POEs)

The Program aims:
PEO-1: To produce competent computer scientists that can apply the knowledge and skills of computer science in diverse fields.
PEO-2: To prepare students to demonstrate professional and ethical practices and a responsible behavior in their respective organization.
PEO-3: To inculcate a zest to enhance their professional development by pursuing advance degrees in their fields.
PEO-4: To impart interpersonal skills so that they can become successful managers, entrepreneurs, and leaders.



Laboratories
There are following labs in the department:
1. General Computing
2. Cloud Computing
3. Digital Logic Design
4. Final Year Project

The General Computing lab serves as a multipurpose facility for students to conduct experiments in computer programming, web development, and mobile application development.

In contrast, Cloud computing provides on-demand access to shared computer processing resources and data via the Internet, reducing the need to store data locally and potentially cutting costs.

The Digital Logic Design Lab features top- of-the-line hardware and software to enable students to perform necessary experiments.

Similarly, the Final Year Project Lab is a dedicated space that supports students in designing, developing, completing, and testing their final year projects.
